    |* Install Node from the EPEL Repository
    |* An alternative installation method uses the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository that is available for CentOS and related distributions.
    | 
    |* To gain access to the EPEL repo, you must modify the repo-list of your installation. Fortunately, we can reconfigure access to this repository by installing a package available in our current repos called epel-release.
    | 
    b
    |* sudo yum install epel-release
    | 
    |* Now that you have access to the EPEL repository, you can install Node.js using your regular yum commands:
    | 
    |* sudo yum install nodejs
    | 
    |* Once again, you can check that the installation was successful by asking Node to return its version number:
    | 
    |* node --version
    | 
    |* v0.10.30
